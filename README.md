TOP rock paper scissors project

This is my first project in JavaScript sourced from the Odin Project curriculum. For starters this will just be a console program, but I will be returning to this to build a user interface. Goal is to put knowledge of functions to use!

This is Rock, Paper, Scissors. The player competes against the computer in 5 rounds and the program will report a winner!
